# trigres (short for trigonometical equation resolver (resolver probably doesn't mean what I meant it to be but who cares))

This is my first real c++ project that I didn't fork from another person and just edit variable names.
It helps to solve trigonometric equations

# Compiling
I used CMake for this, so clone the repo and build it through CMake

excuse the shit code please
